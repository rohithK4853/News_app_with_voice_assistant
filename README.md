This project is about creating a news reading app which is fully operated with voice assistance. In this project, I have used ReactJS library and also used Material UI for making the web app more responsive and attractive. 
I have used Alan AI app voice assistance to enable the voice assistance feature for my news reader web app. Alan AI is an avialable for everyone but it is chargable after reaching the usage limit.
